        <h2>Module 2: Introduction to Embedded C</h2>
            <p>In this session, we begun by being introduced to simple embedded system terms.<br>We learned about Arduino IDE and Thonny as development environment to code our microcontrollers in either c or python respectively.<br>We then did a simple overview of ESP8266 Development board which will be shown below.</p>

            <img src="images/esp8266.png" alt="ESP8266 Pinout Diagram">
            <p>We used this development board as an example to microcontrollers, describing the pins and what they do.<br>we also discussed on which pins should not be connected to.</p>
            <p>Below shows my journey on C language as i tried some simple code.</p>

            <p>Here show the code i wrote on Visual Studio.<br>Its a simple guessing game that prompts the user to guess the number the code randomly picked.<br>Below is its execution on the powershell.</p>

            <p>As shown above, i did a total of 5 atempts in which i guessed until i got the number.</p>

            <p>Here i show how i uploaded my code onto my github repository.</p>
        </div>

            <p>This just shows the guessing game in my github repository.</p>

       <h2>Module 3: Introduction to ESP32 and Electrical Circuits and Components.</h2>
            <p>In this session, we begun by being introduced to simple electrical components.<br>We learnt about Capacitor
Resistor, Diode, Transistor, Inductor, Relay and Quartz Crystal.<br>Let me describe them below and how they work.</p>

            <img src="images/Capacitors.png" alt="Capacitors Diagram">
            <p>A capacitor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that can store energy in an electric field electrostatically.<br>When you apply a voltage over the two plates or connect them to a source, an electric field develops across the insulator, causing one plate to accumulate positive charge while negative charge gets collected on the other.</p>

            <img src="images/Resistors.png" alt="Resistors">
            <p>A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical device that resists the flow of current.<br>It performs a vital function: controlling the voltage and the current in your circuit.</p>

        <div class="project-images">
            <img src="images/Diode.png" alt="Diode">
            <p>A diode is a two-terminal device that allows electric current to flow in only one direction.<br>When the cathode is heated by a filament, an invisible cloud of electrons, called space charge, forms in the vacuum. Though electrons are emitted from the cathode, the negative space charge repels them. As electrons canâ€™t reach the anode, no current flows through the circuit. However, when the anode is made positive, the space charge vanishes.</p>

        <div class="project-images">
            <img src="images/Transistors.png" alt="Transistors">
            <p>Transistors are tiny electronic components that control the flow of electricity in a circuit. Think of them like electronic switches or amplifiers.<br>A transistor is a small electronic component that works like a switch or an amplifier. It has three parts: the base, collector, and emitter. When a small current is applied to the base, it allows a much larger current to flow from the collector to the emitter. Without this base current, the transistor remains off, and no current flows between the collector and emitter.</p>

        <div class="project-images">
            <img src="images/Inductors.png" alt="Uploading Guessing_game">
            <p>An inductor, also known as a reactor, is a passive component of a circuit having two terminals.<br>Whenever the current passes through a wire, it creates a magnetic field. However, the unique shape of the inductor leads to the creation of a much stronger magnetic field.</p>
